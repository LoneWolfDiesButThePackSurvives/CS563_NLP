## Overview

All neural modules, including the tokenzier, the multi-word token (MWT) expander, the POS/morphological features tagger, the lemmatizer, the dependency parser, and the named entity tagger, can be trained with your own data.

To train your own models, you will need to clone the source code from the [stanza git repository](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/stanza) and follow the procedures below. We also provide runnable scripts coupled with toy data that makes it much easier for users to get started with model training, and you can find at [stanza-train git repository](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/stanza-train).

If you only want to run the processors with the pretrained models, please skip this and go to [the Pipeline page](pipeline.md).

## Setting Environment Variables

Run `source config.sh` to set the following environment variables.  You will need to edit these files to set values appropriate for your local system.

You may want to put these variables in your shell startup to save time.  For example, `.bashrc`  In that case, you will not need to run the config script.

Note that Windows users will not be able to run this `.sh` script, but they can still use the python tools after adding these variables via the control panel.  Control Panel -> Edit environment variables and create entries similar to the values in `config.sh`.

We provide scripts that are useful for model training and evaluation in the `scripts` folder, the `stanza/utils/datasets`, and the `stanza/utils/training` directory. The first thing to do before training is to setup the environment variables by editing `scripts/config.sh`. The most important variables include:
- `UDBASE`: This should point to the root directory of your training/dev/test universal dependencies data in [CoNLL-U](https://universaldependencies.org/format.html) format. The dir is organized as `{UDBASE}/{corpus}/{corpus_short}-ud-{train,dev,test}.conllu`. For examples of this folder, you can download the raw data from the [CoNLL 2018 UD Shared Task website](http://universaldependencies.org/conll18/data.html).  This environment variable should point to the root directory for ALL of the datasets, so for example you should have `$UDBASE/UD_English-EWT`, `$UDBASE/UD_Vietnamese-VTB`, etc
- `NERBASE`: This should point to the root directory of your training/dev/test named entity recognition data in [BIO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside–outside–beginning_(tagging)) format. The dir is organized as `{NERBASE}/{corpus}/{train,dev,test}.bio`. For examples of the data, you can read the [CoNLL 2003 Shared Task paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W03-0419.pdf) and download the data.  See [NER Data](training.md#ner-data) for more info.
- `DATA_ROOT`: This is the root directory for storing intermediate training files generated by the scripts.
- `{module}_DATA_DIR`: The subdirectory for storing intermediate files used by each module.
- `WORDVEC_DIR`: The directory to store all word vector files (see below).
- `HANDPARSED_DIR`: A fork of [handparsed-treebank](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/handparsed-treebank), only needed if retraining "combined" models

These variables are used by the `.sh` files in the `scripts` folder.  They are also used by the python scripts, and so they need to be part of your environment.

## Preparing Word Vector Data

To train modules that make use of word representations, such as the POS/morphological features tagger and the dependency parser, it is highly recommended that you use pretrained embedding vectors. The simplest method is to use the `.pt` file in the `$STANZA_RESOURCES/lang/pretrain` directory after downloading the existing models using `stanza.download(lang)`.

```
python
>>> import stanza
>>> stanza.download("vi")   # or whichever language you are using
```

Once this is downloaded, the models each have a flag which tells the model where to find the `.pt` file.  Each of pos, depparse, ner, and sentiment support the `--wordvec_pretrain_file` flag for specifying the exact path.  If you don't supply this flag, it will attempt to guess the location.  In general, it will look in `saved_models/{model}/{dataset}.pretrain.pt`.

For more information and other options, [see here](word_vectors.md).

## Converting UD data

A large repository of data is available at [www.universaldependencies.org](http://www.universaldependencies.org).  Most of our models are trained using this data.  We provide python scripts for converting this data to the format used by our models at training time:
```bash
python -m stanza.utils.datasets.prepare_${module}_treebank ${corpus} ${other_args}
```
where `${module}` is one of `tokenize`, `mwt`, `pos`, `lemma`, or `depparse`; `${corpus}` is the full name of the corpus; `${other_args}` are other arguments allowed by the training script.

### Dependency Parser Data

By default, the `prepare_depparse_treebank.py` script uses the POS tagger to retag the training data.  You can turn this off with the `--gold` flag.

```bash
# This will attempt to load the tagger and retag the data
# You will need to train the tagger or use the existing tagger for that to work
python -m stanza.utils.datasets.prepare_depparse_treebank UD_English-EWT
```

```bash
# You can use the original gold tags as follows
python -m stanza.utils.datasets.prepare_depparse_treebank UD_English-EWT --gold
```

The reasoning is that since the models will be using predicted tags when used in a pipeline, it is better to train the models with the predicted tags in the first place.  In order to get the best results when retraining the dependency parser for use in a pipeline, you should first retrain the tagger if relevant and then use the new tagger model to produce the predicted tags.


### NER Data

NER models have a different data format from other models.  In many
cases, publicly available datasets will be in a non-BIO format.
There is
[a script](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/stanza/blob/main/stanza/utils/datasets/ner/prepare_ner_dataset.py)
which covers a few different publicly available datasets.  The
comments at the top of this script should give a good idea on how to
download the data and use the script.

Note that the script uses `NERBASE` quite often.  This will default to
`extern_data/ner` from wherever you are running the script.  If you
organize the datasets in a different directory, you will want to set
the `NERBASE` environment variable accordingly.

```bash
export NERBASE=/home/john/ner
python3 -m stanza.utils.datasets.ner.prepare_ner_dataset
```

For example:

```bash
python -m stanza.utils.datasets.ner.prepare_ner_dataset fi_turku
```

On Windows, you can set the `NERBASE` environment variable via the control panel.

Note that for the various scripts supported, you need to first download the data (possibly after agreeing to a license) from the sources listed in the file.

For a new dataset not already supported, there is a specific `.json` format expected by our models.  There is a conversion script called several times in `prepare_ner_dataset.py` which converts [IOB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside%E2%80%93outside%E2%80%93beginning_\(tagging\)) format to our internal NER format:

```python
import stanza.utils.datasets.ner.prepare_ner_file as prepare_ner_file

prepare_ner_file.process_dataset(input_iob, output_json)
```

The program will look for the `.json` files in the `data/ner` directory, which you may need to create if this is your first time training a Stanza NER model.
You can change the expected path by setting the `$NER_DATA_DIR` environment variable.

## Training with Scripts

We provide various scripts to ease the training process in the `scripts` and `stanza/utils/training` directories. To train a model, you can run the following command from the code root directory:
```bash
python -m stanza.utils.training.run_${module} ${corpus} ${other_args}
```
where `${module}` is one of `tokenize`, `mwt`, `pos`, `lemma`, `depparse`, or `ner`; `${corpus}` is the full name of the corpus; `${other_args}` are other arguments allowed by the training script.

For example, you can use the following command to train a tokenizer with batch size 32 and a dropout rate of 0.33 on the `UD_English-EWT` corpus:

```bash
python -m stanza.utils.training.run_tokenize UD_English-EWT --batch_size 32 --dropout 0.33
```

NER is not trained from the UD datasets, but from other external datasets specific to each language.  Nevertheless, there is a `run_ner.py` script:

```bash
python -m stanza.utils.training.run_ner ${corpus} ${other_args}

python -m stanza.utils.training.run_ner fi_turku
```

You can also run `ner_tagger.py` directly:

```bash
python3 -m stanza.models.ner_tagger --wordvec_pretrain_file saved_models/pos/fi_ftb.pretrain.pt --train_file data/ner/fi_turku.train.json --eval_file data/ner/fi_turku.dev.json  --charlm --charlm_shorthand fi_conll17 --char_hidden_dim 1024  --lang fi --shorthand fi_turku --mode train
```

To get the prediction scores of an existing NER model when running `ner_tagger.py`, use `--mode eval` instead of `--mode train`.

If you are training NER for a new language, you may want to use a [charlm](new_language.md#character-lm).  You can also leave out the charlm arguments in the above command line and train without the charlm.

For a full list of available training arguments, please refer to the specific entry point of that module. By default model files will be saved to the `saved_models` directory during training (which can also be changed with the `save_dir` argument).

## Evaluation

Model evaluation will be run automatically after each training run.

You can also run a single model's dev or test set by using the `run_${module}.py` script with the `--score_dev` or `--score_test` flag.

Additionally, after you finish training all modules, you can evaluate the full universal dependency parsing pipeline with this command:
```bash
python -m stanza.utils.training.run_ete ${corpus} --score_${split}
```
where `${split}` is one of `dev` or `test`.  Running with no `--score_` flag will give scores for the train data.


## Devices

We **strongly encourage** you to train all modules with a **GPU** device. When a CUDA device is available and detected by the script, the CUDA device will be used automatically; otherwise, CPU will be used. However, you can force the training to happen on a CPU device, by specifying `--cpu` when calling the script.
